# Personal Website

## Description
A personal website which includes a bio, resume, and home page.

## Implementation
I believe all aspects of the work have been correctly implemented. However,
the github commits were not always consistent as I was on a road trip and did
much of the work offline.

## Collaboration
I did not collaborate on this lab with anyone.

## Time Commitment
I spent around 6 hours working on this project.
