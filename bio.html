                I am a sophmore at Tufts University working toward a masters
                in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity as
                well as a bachelors of science in applied mathematics.
                I am an avid puzzler and part of the Tufts Math Society.
                I have extensive teaching experience and enjoy developing
                critical thinking and leadership skills in my students.

                When I have a spare moment, I enjoy working on cybersecurity
                CTFs (Capture the Flag Games), digital art, or any
                type of puzzle.
