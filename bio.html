                                I am a sophmore at Tufts University working toward a masters
                                in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity as
                                well as a bachelors of science in applied mathematics.
                                I am an avid puzzler and part of the Tufts Math Society.
                                I have extensive teaching experience and enjoy developing
                                critical thinking and leadership skills in my students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                When I have a spare moment, I enjoy working on cybersecurity
                                CTFs (Capture the Flag Games), digital art, or any
                                type of puzzle.
